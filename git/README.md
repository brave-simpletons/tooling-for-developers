# Configuration for Git

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

This folder contains configuration for git and also the shell integration of the git-bash (using the `reg` files)

These files are configured with the assumption that you are using [SCOOP](https://scoop.sh).

## Git Config

Update your global `.gitconfig` with the content of the `gitconfig.txt`

The git config file can be used at any configuration level: system, global or local.

For more info, you can read the official documentation of about [git config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)

## Git-Bash Shell Integration

If you want to install or uninstall the Git-Bash context menu integration (when git is installed from "scoop"), you can use the regedit files
