# Configuration for Git

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

This folder contains configuration for git and also the shell integration of the git-bash (using the `reg` files)

These files are configured with the assumption that you are using [SCOOP](https://scoop.sh), as we do ;)

## Git Config

Update your global `.gitconfig` with the content of the `gitconfig.txt`

Your global `.gitconfig` should be in your "%userprofile%" (or "~") folder

## Git-Bash Shell Integration

If you want to install or uninstall the Git-Bash context menu integration (when git is installed from "scoop"), you can use the regedit files
