# Configuration for the registry

## Overview

This folder contains some nice registry tweaks to help you being more productive

## Naming convention

Each files must be named using a self explanatory syntax, minimally such as this example : {registrykey}-{action}-{value_name|values_description}.reg => filesystem-enabling-longpaths.reg

- registrykey : The key where the value(s) will be stored
- action : Action that will be perform on values and/or registry key (like, but not limited to: enable, disable, remove, install, uninstall, ...)
- value_name|values_description : represent the name of the value, or a description of a group of values, that will be impacted with that registry file.

## Update the registry

You only need to double click on the ".reg" file of your choosing based on what you intent to do. As described earlier file name of these files should be [self explanatory](#naming-convention).
